Multi Utility Program for Bitcoin

This program uses no external libraries besides the one in the STL. That means
established hash algorithms (SHA256 and RIPEMD160), arbitrary precision
integers, and elliptic curve cryptography are implemented from scratch. This is
obviously a bad idea which you should never do in practice, but I am doing so
in the interests of paranoia (no rigged secret key generation), intellectual
exercise (reading papers and converting to code), fun, and maybe profit!.
